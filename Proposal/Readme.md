## Overview
Reviews on websites as simple it sounds; but it has a significant impact on how tourists choose their accommodation. It is vital for hotels to have reputation for quality and it would work as trustable verification for the hotel quality. A recent Barclays study showed there is potential of an extra Â£3.2 billion, by just paying more attention to online reviews. The dataset that was collected from Booking.com.

The *goal* of this project is to build unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) machine learning models that decide whether a text review is positive review or negative review. This project, will help hotels to determine the category of text review and cluster them automaticity to improve their services
